The Skyview sources by HEASARC
==============================

This project contains the Java sources for the Skyview packages in skyview.jar
downloaded from https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/docs/jar.html on 2018-12-28.

At that time the version of Skyview was 3.4.2.

The idea is to build a fraction of these Java sources into jars that will
resolve dependencies in a FITS reader implementation.
