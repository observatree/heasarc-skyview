The Skyview geometry sources by HEASARC
=======================================

This project contains the Java sources for the Skyview geometry package.
It contains only a small subset of the sources in skyview.jar.

The sources were downloaded from 
https://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/docs/jar.html on 2018-12-28.
At that time the version of Skyview was 3.4.2.

The idea is to build this small fraction of the Java sources into
jars that will resolve dependencies in a FITS reader implementation.
